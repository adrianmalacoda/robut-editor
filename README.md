# Text Editor 8000
Text editor for Android. Forked from [Turbo Editor](https://github.com/vmihalachi/turbo-editor) by Vlad Mihalachi.

## Notice
This project undergoes sporadic bursts of activity. There's no timeframe for a release, and stuff gets worked on when it gets worked on.

The general policy is that master is always buildable and should run fine, but there's no guarantees.

Also, at some point nightly builds may be available. Use at your own risk!
