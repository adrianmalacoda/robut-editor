## Notice
This project undergoes sporadic bursts of activity. There's no timeframe for a release, and stuff gets worked on when it gets worked on.

The general policy is that master is always buildable and should run fine, but there's no guarantees.

Also, [build artifacts](https://gitlab.monarch-pass.net/malacoda/text-editor-8000/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build-apk) from master are available on the Monarch Pass GitLab. Use at your own risk!
